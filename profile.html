            Hi, I’m Yassir, a 10-year-old web developer who loves building cool
            stuff online! I started learning HTML and CSS just for fun, but now
            I can make full websites on my own. I’ve even started experimenting
            with Inline CSS (were you use CSS inside your Html code Most of the
            people think that Inline CSS is the worst type of way to use CSS)
            Coding makes me feel like I can create anything I imagine, and it’s
            awesome to see my ideas come to life on a screen. I might be young,
            but I’m just getting started!
